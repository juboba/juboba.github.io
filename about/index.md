My name is Julio Borja Barra. I'm a chilean developer currently living in CÃ¡diz,
Spain.

#### Javascript

I've been developing applications using PHP frameworks for a while and for the
last two years I've been dedicating my time to learn about the internals of Javascript
and developing applications using AngularJS and REST APIs.

One of the things I like about Javascript is how the community influences the
language. There are a lots of cases where solutions to local problems lead to
great patterns that allow us to do fun stuff, like closures, promises, etc.

#### Slackware Linux

I've been a Slackware user since 2005 and I love it. The KISS principle is something
that drives Slackware to be one the simplest linux distributions available.

#### Open Source

Besides the great importance of ethics in software development, I find great
utility in sharing code. Since everything we create is by using something that was
available, I think depriving people of using something or knowing how it was created
just cuts the chain of development.

I think it's a comforting feeling when you discover someone created something new 
with something you made available.

### The languages I like
* Javascript (of course)
* Rust
